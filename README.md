# Row-Match-type-2D-Puzzle-Game

Row-match 2D game with 10 levels. Like candy crush but player only gets point if he/she makes 
all row same colour. For etc. if all row elements are green then player gets points with respected to its colour points and the row 
locked whicih maes that rowâ€™s elements unmoveable. Highest scores are set to 1000 from default and if user finishes the 
level with a score higher than 1000, then the new level is being opened. Developed and specified the game by watching an 
Udemy course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/ ) But could not finish the course yet, Continue to develop it in my spare times. All the levels takes places in the same scene with changing width,  height etc. configurations.

The code of the game provides flexibility for level creation. As I mentioned, all the levels are take places at the same scene with changing the camera configruations respected to that level. Also the levels are hardcoded in the code. The order of dots(colourful game objects) are taken by hardcoded statement and level is generated with respected. In other words, code is able to create the coloured dots in the desired order in the gameboard and also code is able to create them totally randomly because it also has this functionality.

Reset Levels button for setting all highest scores to 1000, the next level is being opened if user passes current level with a score higher than that level's highest.
